<h1 align="center">Full Marine Tower</h1>
This BTD6 mod makes the Marine a fully upgradeable tower with three theme-designed paths.

* This is the first BTD6 mod I've ever made!
* Thanks to everyone on the 1330 Studios discord server who helped me make this mod! (https://discord.gg/1330studios)

Modding BTD6 always comes with the risk of getting flagged!!!
